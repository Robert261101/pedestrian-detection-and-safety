    Pedestrian Detection System

This project implements a pedestrian detection system using Python and OpenCV. The system detects pedestrians in video footage from urban environments, particularly at intersections or crosswalks. It can be used to improve pedestrian safety by alerting drivers or adjusting traffic signals accordingly.

    Features
-Detect pedestrians in real-time video streams or pre-recorded video files.

-Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier for pedestrian detection.

-Provides visual feedback by drawing rectangles around detected pedestrians.

-Gracefully handles the end of the video file and user input for quitting the application.
