Pedestrian Detection System
This project implements a pedestrian detection system using Python and OpenCV. The system detects pedestrians in video footage from urban environments, particularly at intersections or crosswalks. It can be used to improve pedestrian safety by alerting drivers or adjusting traffic signals accordingly.

Features
Detect pedestrians in real-time video streams or pre-recorded video files.
Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier for pedestrian detection.
Provides visual feedback by drawing rectangles around detected pedestrians.
Gracefully handles the end of the video file and user input for quitting the application.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV library (opencv-python)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pedestrian-detection.git
Install the required Python dependencies:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Run the pedestrian detection script:

Copy code
python pedestrian_detection.py
Usage
Specify the path to the video file in the video_file variable in the script.
Run the script, and the pedestrian detection system will display the video with rectangles drawn around detected pedestrians.
Press the 'q' key to quit the application.
